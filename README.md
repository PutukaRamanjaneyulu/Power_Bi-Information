   - Define **one-to-many (1:M) and many-to-many (M:M) relationships**.  
✅ **When to Use?**  
   - When **connecting multiple tables** for better data interaction.  

🔹 **Example:** Linking a **Sales Table (OrderID)** with a **Customers Table (CustomerID)** using relationships.  

---

## **🔹 4. DAX Query View**  
✅ **Purpose:** Used for **writing and testing DAX formulas**.  
✅ **Features:**  
   - Create **Measures** and **Calculated Columns**.  
   - Perform **advanced calculations** on datasets.  
   - Test **DAX expressions** for performance optimization.  
✅ **When to Use?**  
   - When working with **complex calculations and aggregations**.  

🔹 **Example:** Writing a **DAX formula to calculate Total Sales**:  
   ```DAX
   Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])
   ```
